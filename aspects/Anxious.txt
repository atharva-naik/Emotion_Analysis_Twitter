@USER They all have covid - 19 now and the death rate from covid - 19 in the UK is 40,540 it will be above 150,000 because of these protesters ... !
If a second wave of this Coronavirus hits and we go into lockdown again like shops closing , schools , work etc etc , not to sure how much more people could take . A lot of people could n't handle the last 10 or 11 weeks on a soft lockdown doubt they could handle anymore of it .
Because of the protests in the UK deaths from covid - 19 will be above 150,000 by the end of the year in could be even 300,000 deaths from covid - 19 ... HTTPURL

The sense of distress with which the peaking of coronavirus deaths in Italy was reported and received in the UK is now strangely absent as our own fatality rate nears 1,000 per day . Missing too is the urgent need to understand why this is happening . HTTPURL
Contact Tracing is one of the essential tools needed in the #COVID19 crisis . But it has downsides : 1 . the potential to stigmatise people 2 . only works for complete datasets 3 . has potential to increase panic among those who have n't had the virus .
The 10,000 is not counting those elderly who have died in nursing homes or alone at home ... horrendous HTTPURL

@USER Cummings could have had no way of knowing that his son was not infected with coronavirus before they started the journey to Durham . Totally reckless , in my book .
So he 's never been tested for Coronavirus , yet he had symptoms ? I 'm confused , do n't people who have symptoms get the test done ?
260k people in the UK have been confirmed as having COVID 19 . I imagine quite a lot of them have children and have had to just deal with the situation . Principally on the instructions of #dominiccummings !
Cummings : ‘ I was worried that people were n't taking it ( a potential Coronavirus pandemic ) seriously enough ' #cummingsstatement
Imagine if an antibody test reveals they never had Covid - 19 . I thought if during lockdown I became too unwell to stay at home , I would call 999 and if I had Covid - 19 symptoms , I will be tested in the hospital . Exactly what happened with Cumming 's child . HTTPURL

@USER If the prime ministers ' senior adviser did n't have any child care arrangements in place for possible scenarios of suffering with COVID - 19 especially being the key worker that he is , what did they expect everyone else in the UK to do who were told to PROTECT FAMILY , STAY HOME
Look . My brother has anxiety , depression and OCD . My grannie has dementia and there 's a high chance she wo n't recognise me when I ( eventually ) see her again . I can't stress this enough , just be safe . Do n't risk it for momentary pleasure . For all , not one . #COVID19
My eyes are fucked after a bout of Coronavirus . A 30 minute non essential drive should determine if they are ok . This man must think we are all of the age where we still believe in fairy tales .
@USER @USER @USER @USER He was thinking about his family and child . If he 'd been involved in an accident en route with both adults suffering Covid 19 symptoms the 999 services attending would be put at risk as would their families . So no I have no sympathy for his position
Think it was covid 19 his wife had why was he panicked he would also get ill in the same time period ? If he did think she had COVID 19 why did he drive back down to London to tie up some work mess before driving back ? Fuckin hell I have more questions than answers . Fuck this shit .
@USER I had COVID - 19 and my eyes was affected
@USER If you were a paramedic or a police officer called to an accident involving two adults who had Covid 19 and chosen to drive 250 miles without permission , how would you feel about the safety of your children at home when you had to treat these thoughtless people and be exposed ?

@USER Sorry to hear of the loss of your mother . It 's such a dreadful time . I have a mother in a Nursing Home so I get worried about her . But fortunately the home has n't had any cases of coronavirus .
If the health and safety of your 4yr old child is paramount , why oh why would you risk taking that very same child on a 30mile drive when you are already feeling ill & are dubious about your eyesight . Absolutely ridiculous & beyond belief . #DominicCummngs #BarnardCastle #COVID19
Ca n't believe what I have just seen on #BBC news . Southend on sea beach packed with people and no social distancing . In danger of another spike in Coronavirus . Where were the Police ? !
Awful that their child was ill but I thought people were asked not to drive to second ( or third ) homes so as not to put additional strain on ambulance / NHS services . This was what the #COVID19 lockdown was supposed to avoid was n't it but is precisely what Cummings did .
So if i fell ill n there was no one to look after my children the care system wud have to deal with them like everyone else . I cudnt send them to my parents as my mum is high risk . I smell BULLSHIT @USER as do the rest of the uk . I dont care if he resigns but its lies HTTPURL
@USER Here the most recent one ... HTTPURL And the issue is wider than just PO , it 's what impact it will have on the general public 's behaviour going forward . Surely lockdown was supposed to prevent infected people travelling ... #CummingStatement #COVID19 #lockdownuk

Apparently eye sight can be affected by Coronavirus ? :thinking_face: :thinking_face: :flushed_face: #bbcnews

Fantastic idea but do n't ask me to read them to patients as I would be a blubbering mess HTTPURL
@USER @USER 3 Brighton players with confirmed Covid 19 . There is no chance that this can happen .
Stay Alert . Britain needs lerts . #StayAlert #coronavirus
It 's as if elderly people are justifiable collateral damage of #coronavirus . Care homes have been a huge and silent killer . How long will this continue ? What will be done to prevent this happening to other people and families ? Will this simply be another cover-up ? (8 /8 )
Let 's not muddy the waters about the new message - we CAN stay alert for symptoms we experience . Could it be Covid - 19 or something less deadly ?
Ludicrous that lockdown is being eased so soon . No doubt ICU will be rammed again in a few weeks ! ! Sha n't get too comfy in my office ! ! ! #COVIDIOTS #BorisResign HTTPURL
Well well - we 're top of the list for something :fearful_face: #StayHomeSaveLives #COVID19 HTTPURL
It seemed hard to believe that the situation for people in the Cahersiveen #DirectProvision could be any more horrendous - and now this ... @USER @USER when will someone take action in response to the residents ' plea #MoveUsOut ? HTTPURL
@USER Sir , I do n't think it 's a good idea with all due respect , to change ' lock down ' measures when you have a lot of idiots congregating in Parks & doing the conga in the HTTPURL is that protecting our NHS heroes ? #COVIDIOTS #covid19
Keeping myself alert for that pesky virus coming up the garden path #stayalert HTTPURL HTTPURL
@USER If Gove is really saying " RUN THIS HOT " :backhand_index_pointing_down: meaning lift Lockdown in :black_flag: 󠁧 󠁢 󠁥 󠁮 󠁧 󠁿 while Covid 19 is still deadly Then surely it 's time for :black_flag: 󠁧 󠁢 󠁷 󠁬 󠁳 󠁿 & :black_flag: 󠁧 󠁢 󠁳 󠁣 󠁴 󠁿 to close the borders ? HTTPURL
As much as I want lockdown to be lifted it will be such a dumb decision if we do rn HTTPURL
@USER @USER That 's interesting ; the death of an infant by Covid 19 ? Unusual is n't that ?
My anxiety is so high , feel like we 're going to end up with a second wave of coronavirus :weary_face: :loudly_crying_face:
Or the calls from random members of the public . “ Hello , police ? I 'd like to report a suspicious COVID - 19 lurking around outside my house ... ” HTTPURL
@USER @USER Is Bristol Professor wanting to replace Professor Ferguson ? : #coronavirus could cause more deaths ' than the Second World War ' HTTPURL via @USER HTTPURL
So it seems the reason we 've been doing so badly against Coronavirus so far is we have n't been alert enough against something we can't see and we have n't developed magical powers of virus control Or something #StayAlert #ControlTheVirus #SaveLives HTTPURL
There 's no way this is representative but at least based on 8,500 responses in Wales . Shame results not broken down by sector . Questions about schools reopening are not easy to interpret . Also useful to compare with responses from rest of uk :backhand_index_pointing_down: HTTPURL
Does " stay alert " mean we are now expected to report people if we think they might have #COVID19 ? Or are we on the look out for the virus . Do we have to be alert in our homes . What on earth does it mean ?
@USER I have nothing to report Sir . No sign of #coronavirus HTTPURL
Please avoid crowding outside :folded_hands: . We are having to pick up the pieces in the #NHS #SocialDistancing #StaySafeSaveLives #coronavirus #COVID19 @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL
Coronavirus could cause more deaths ' than the Second World War ' HTTPURL via HTTPURL
As someone who has a low / compromised immune system and currently shielding , the thought of tonight 's announcement coupled with press coverage of the general public 's behaviour this week absolutely terrifies me #StayHomeSaveLives #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #StayAlert
@USER And if Gove tries to " RUN THIS HOT " :backhand_index_pointing_down: pls close the border , right away . HTTPURL
This advice is dangerously ambiguous . 600 + people are still dying every day , the only way we can “ start to recover from coronavirus ” is to #StayHome HTTPURL
Fucking state of our country :flushed_face: :exploding_head: HTTPURL
Me now staying alert as to not get Coronavirus HTTPURL
There is a risk in ignoring risk . Zero harm cultures are not harmless . HTTPURL
The knock effects of this virus are many HTTPURL
@USER intrigued by your research into the choir who was sick with covid 19 symptoms in Jan . Myself and others were also extremely ill with the same symptoms as covid 19 in mid October.We ' re in Hertfordshire , could it have been circulating far earlier than officially known ?
I thought about applying for one of the virus tracker jobs , ringing people with confirmed #COVID19 and tracking their contacts . Govt are paying £ 9 an hour , sod that . @USER @USER pay me what I 'm worth and I 'll do the job for you . Should 've happened months ago
@USER well this is going to kill a lot of people #COVID19 HTTPURL
I 'm sorry but if the comparison between these figures does not put things into perspective and the Government do decide to ease lockdown then let 's just say ... our government have failed us fucking miserably . #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #lockdownuk #coronavirusuk #StayHomeSaveLives HTTPURL
How can we have any confidence that the Scottish Government are properly protecting our care home residents from #Covid19 when even the Health Secretary appears unaware of the updated guidance ; guidance which is already published on their own website . HTTPURL
Remember to always stay alert when out and about . If you spot COVID - 19 , cross the road and call 111 . Easy to spot , you can't miss it :thumbs_up: :medium_light_skin_tone: HTTPURL
Wait for a couple of months and you will get the real effect of #COVID19 and I agree all-mortality is the real answer HTTPURL
Threat Level Midnight ? ? @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL
This now gives people a licence to go out and carry on then .. far too vague . Can we now see family and friends if we stay 2m apart ? HTTPURL
Can only see a nasty backlash from this 7pm statement today especially after what just been said , I honestly reckon there 's going to be a second massive wave of COVID 19 , people just do n't follow the rules and will carry on being selfish
@USER I 'm starting to suspect whether he even had Covid 19 or not . Surely after a near death experience , you would do a lot more . Put down stricter lockdown measures and so on .
Here comes the 2nd wave ? HTTPURL
How have any of those instructions / recommendations got anything to do with staying alert ? Understand there 's a need for the economy to restart and people better placed than me will know how , and when , to do this safely but #stayalert really is a rubbish message . HTTPURL
Politics as usual seems to be order of the day . The break down in communication and collapse in relations between the UK and Scottish Governments will be a worry for many borders communities . More people travel to England from South Scotland on a daily basis for work ( 1/2 ) HTTPURL
So what are you actually saying here , Boris ? Are we staying at home or not ? Are we going to work or not ? Are we allowed to see family and friends or not ? I praised you at first but the longer this has gone on , the more of a circus your government has turned out to be . HTTPURL
This is very worrying . It was thought that children would n't be severly affected by CVD . HTTPURL
Good leadership means clear , direct messages . This is awful , leaving people to make their own mind up , shirking responsibility , very confusing and definitely not what this country needs right now . ‘ Stay alert ' to something we can't see :face_with_rolling_eyes: HTTPURL
Oppose attempts by #BorisJohnson to prematurely end #COVID19 #lockdown - more people will die & #BAME communities will continue to suffer deaths disproportionately . Add names to call by @USER and more for independent #PublicInquiryNow HTTPURL #FiveTests HTTPURL
@USER Agreed . Very confused about this . It makes it sound like coronavirus is a thief and we need to stay alert otherwise it will steal our purse :grinning_face_with_sweat:
Stay alert . If you see a common cold , germ or flu bug disguised as a nun or a circus clown , chances are it 's Coronavirus . Do not approach it without protection . Control it with a plastic bag or a mitten soaked in gin . Save lives .
Stay alert ? ! A set of guidelines rich in ambiguity . People will exploit and vulnerable people will be put at risk . I wish I lived in Scotland . #stayingalertwillnotsavelives HTTPURL
Not surprised by decision but allocation of funds needs to be secured for domestic violence sector in NI urgently by our own assembly @USER HTTPURL
“ Stay alert ” if you see the virus coming , please hide behind a bush until it has past . HTTPURL
So days after Germany relaxes lockdown , cases are on a rapid rise again . There is NO way to resolve Covid - 19 spread outside of social restrictions unless you get on top of that early like New Zealand or a vaccine is developed . The latter will take months if not longer . HTTPURL
Can , @USER stop work to comply with Govt instruction ? , If not , should @USER not force them to close . Save the #NHS HTTPURL
Honestly if the government lift lockdown and say we can see family etc tonight with COVID - 19 still present and putting millions of at risk people in danger I 'll cry
How terrifying that our short term future lies with Buffoon Boris . If someone had said this 12 months ago you 'd have been sectioned . Time to call crisis in confidence in bumbling Gov't and install coalition led by @USER & @USER #COVID19
Vague and dangerous . This is going to put so many people at risk in many ways . HTTPURL
Stay alert for a virus you can only detect with certainty by testing which the Government has n't provided for HTTPURL
Beware , journalists ! HTTPURL
Covid - 19 is turnung us into spies . What 's my neighbour doing ? Is there an additional person sitting in their garden ? Why so many people walking ? Did I see that person walking down the road earlier . This is their second walk ? Why do you need a plant from supermarket :thinking_face:
Wow . Does anyone else find this disturbing ? ! HTTPURL
Meanwhile in Scotland , we 've been releasing potential carires of COVID - 19 in Care Homes ( where the most vulnerable stay ) without checking they have it , and the Heath Secretary does n't know appear to be aware ! BOTH THE SCOTTISH AND UK GOVERNMENTS ARE A MESS ! HTTPURL
This message will actually cost people lives as conditions other thank COVID 19 are going untreated . The NHS is n't overrun we all know this now so please open the country back up . HTTPURL
Heartbreaking . Dread to think how many more doctors will lose their lives to #Suicide especially during & after #COVID19 HTTPURL
Surely we do n't want to be Alert ! #StayAlert #coronavirus #day44oflockdown #BorisJohnson HTTPURL
@USER Do the people of the devolved nations want Covid - 19 death rates equivalent to USA . To put current deaths into perspective , if all CORVID - 19 related deaths are counted in April , it amounts to at least 40,000 in UK . Thats , about 10 % of all UK WW2 deaths . In ONE MONTH .
As you are our local hospital this is very worrying , and puts my friends who work with you at risk . HTTPURL
@USER Second COVID 19 wave here we come .
Inquiry #WeNeedAnswers must review Hospital and GP records along with local authority data HTTPURL We urgently require evidence based risk assessment tools to augment current approach to reduce #COVID19 mortality . Data on ethnicity should be recorded on death cert HTTPURL HTTPURL
And pigs might fly . This has been mishandled badly from the start and so many lives could have been saved . We had enough warning . Borders closed , testing , tracing , treatment and lockdown weeks earlier . Herd immunity still ? Yes . #COVID19 HTTPURL
What does this even mean ? ? Stay alert ? Is this virus gonna jump me or what HTTPURL
So “ Stay Alert ” by staying at home ! Has anything changed ? :confused_face: :thinking_face: :face_with_medical_mask: HTTPURL
@USER I thought the 10 people thing was for the majority of people but not the very high risk . Either way the Coronavirus NHS text service says they 'll be providing an update and new letter next week regarding what the changes mean for the Gov high risk group .
#covid19 So I can go out if I want , I can see small amount of people , must keep 2 metres apart when possible ? So Lockdowns over and now 1000 ' s of people are going to Get Sick and die ! Mixed messages , think I 'll continue to hide , this is n't a good move , surely ? #confussed HTTPURL

@USER What 's your local Council ? What is their refuse collection during Coronavirus ? Our schedule had been affected but not to the extent its need to drive to dump my rubbish .
I 'm really worried that we 're heading for disaster . Very scared . HTTPURL
@USER @USER True but medical interventions are the only way to help those who have covid 19 . The ill can't wait for vaccines and lockdowns do n't stop the virus they only delay it . We will need solutions . The scientific world are working on them . The NHS is working on them . We will beat this .
Good grief this is truly shocking HTTPURL
My mum has been getting concerned text messages from colleagues in Pakistan who are worried by the UK 's coronavirus response ...
So anyone who catches Covid - 19 from now on only has themselves to blame because they were n't being alert enough . Do I have that right ? ? HTTPURL
None ? Not one ? Then conversations need to be had about moving this forward . We can not continue to strangle the life out of the county when we have statistics like this . HTTPURL
There 's a further outbreak of Coronavirus in Germany after an initial lockdown restriction . Our health and well being is paramount . If this means a month of staying home then so be it . I 'm coping .
If I had lost a family member in a care home due to COVID - 19 or even had a relative currently in one , I 'd be absolutely fuming with Jeane Freeman . Health secretary is unaware of own guidance . Fascination with blaming Westminster when there is negligence in our own country . HTTPURL

The new UK #StayAlert messaging ( are n't we alert anyway unless in a coma ? ) is prompting absolutely everyone to drive around in their cars today . I can't recall seeing so much traffic outside our house on a Sunday or any day really . Bracing myself for 2nd Covid wave in the UK . :crying_face: HTTPURL
So those who died including NHS and key workers were n't sufficiently alert ? HTTPURL
How can we ' stay alert ' to a virus ? What does it look like ? What does it smell like ? What does it feel like ? HTTPURL
Horrific .. Up to 43m Americans could lose health insurance amid pandemic , report says HTTPURL

269 dead today COVID 19 . Always low on a Sunday . Back up to 400 + tomorrow :skull:
Ca n't forget how terrifying the news they put out about Italy before coronavirus properly hit us was and now our death toll has surpassed them they 're broadcasting hundreds of people singing a song
Just done some calculations . If I were to get coronavirus my fatality risk is aprox 0.9 % given my health and demographic data ( I am BMI obese which makes it higher than thinner people ) . This sounds low but is hundreds of times higher than my normal daily risk of death ...
Lower death toll today , positive tests still hanging on around 4k bit as a % of all tests is dropping . Still lots to do before we are thru this HTTPURL
@USER seeing this in my own city makes me think I 'm living in a parallel universe , HTTPURL
@USER I think we should be worrying more about the present situation . Politicians need to communicate better and put politics to one side . #StayHomeSaveLives #coronavirus

So we 've got a 5 level alert system . We were at 4 and we 're partly moving to 3 . But not completely . Which makes you wonder why we did n't make it a 6 level system so we could go from 5 to 4 instead of 3 and a half . #spinaltap #COVID19

Watching the covid 19 press conference and it says 539 deaths of people who tested positive for covid 19 . That sounds alot to me like we are recording deaths of people with covid 19 alongside deaths caused by covid 19 . It would be nice to know how our reporting compares the world

This explains better than I could why I 'm skeptical of those who are confident , good or bad , about judging the gov 's response . What we can all agree on , is there has been a tragic lost in life . That raises questions , some immediate ( PPE ? ) , but many will take longer to answer . HTTPURL

This is what I tweeted on April 18 : Care home deaths are a national scandal . No one in isolation should die from coronavirus .

@USER @USER Heard last wk from someone who works in a care home , a dear resident was already in their ‘ end of life stage ' yet their death would be counted as COVID - 19 related - which is worrying , as untested as far as they knew & unfair .
Now I might not be great with the math , BUT does this mean in Scotland the mortality rate is approximately 10 % or if on trend with predicted 2.5 % mortality rate there could be approx 50,000 cases , meaning 40,000 have gone undiagnosed ? HTTPURL

Hi @USER over 3mn people infected by COVID 19 in US . Do you have any plan to control and save your country . I agree to do that you need a brain which you are lacking . I feel sorry for the Americans . Do n't worry Don . Keep faith in the bible you were holding as prop .

@USER @USER Exactly so , it means we will be on our own , far from the front of the queue , should an effective #COVID19 enter the market place . A short term decision , based on anti-EU bias , could have longer term consequences for UK 's economy . Just as failure to control infection spread / 2

Good . Best way to guarantee this whole thing fails is if staff are n't provided adequate PPE and they all get sick / have to self-isolate / worse . Who will be looking after patients then when we have double the demand and half the staff ? This government is a joke . HTTPURL

Care home deaths are a national scandal . No one in isolation should die from coronavirus . Carers and new patients are the only people from outside to come in contact with the patients . Either the carers were not provided with adequate clothing or the new intake were not tested .

UK announces 449 more coronavirus victims HTTPURL via @USER This is now scary . @USER Why are you easing lockdown , when deaths are still so high ? You will condemn many teachers , their families and the communities they serve to a rise in deaths . :pleading_face:

There are so much talk about healthcare workers getting Covid - 19 from work . Am I the only one who noticed that we are the worst in maintaining distancing at work ? Transmission between workers can't be underestimated .
@USER @USER @USER In addition , my concern is who / how will anything be managed given challenges faced by a MH services prior to Covid 19 . Felt like MH services ( as a whole ) were struggling to meet increased demand with fewer staff , beds , funding and lower moral / high turnover !
This information came as a shock to me . No health workers in Germany have died of coronavirus . In the UK over 150 have died . That 's beyond carelessness .

How do you keep children 2 metres apart ? It 's a myth that children do n't get #COVID19 . If you open schools , more people will die . This govt is playing roulette with people 's lives . 30k ppl dead is ridiculous and it 's because of this Govt 's incompetence . They have to be removed .

1 . Do explain how caring for your child includes exposing your kid to one , almost certainly two parents who know they have coronavirus in the confines of a car for several hours ? 2 . Disingenuous horseshit . You know the criticism is n't about “ caring for your wife and child ” . HTTPURL
@USER if you track and trace are you able to trace it back to infection 1 ? ? Would be interesting to all those who have sadly lost family and friends to the virus where the first infected person came from - asking for a friend #COVID19 HTTPURL
@USER @USER No , a young child 's chances of dying after contracting Covid - 19 is nearly zero , but as a parent you can do more to limit that chance then you can limit the chance of being struck by lightning , which is a far more random event .
What really caring Parent would put a child in a car and less than 2 meters away from a parent with confirmed Covid 19 and travels to a location 3 hours or more away .. I note Cummings had a brother in London ... and it was his mother 's birthday . Just saying ... HTTPURL
2/3 If no , has there been a proper thinking of how to deal with the consequent issues ? e . g . What are the options ? What are the effects on patients etc .. ? #covid19
Because of coronavirus outbreak whole world is panic God knows when we will all come out of it .

@USER @USER There are over 30,000 families grieving for their loved ones lost to coronavirus and they 've got to abide by the lockdown rules there mental health will be very severe and damaged because of not being able to get support . X
The rules are you must self isolate if you have #COVID19 or signs . It does n't say if it should be your family home or your home . Surely the most sensible is where you have help . No point isolating on your own , you 'll be dead ! HTTPURL
There seems to be some sort of false sense of security re #COVID19 in the UK . 282 People died of it yesterday . Just let that sink in .

i am convinced i had it late february / early march . i was coughing so hard my ribs hurt , i had a high fever and was wheezing when breathing . HTTPURL
Just in case anyone else has n't seen the guidelines , if you or anyone in your household have symptoms of Covid - 19 you should ALL self-isolate in your house for 14 days . That 's everyone . Even Tories . #StayAlert #ControlTheVirus #SaveLives HTTPURL
@USER Question . Did they make the trip there & back without a stop over , as without a break , the distance traveled could be a unsafe , perhaps copies of service stations CCTV could revel if they did make stops on their journeys when having systems of Covid - 19
Unbelievable & truly shocking ! I feel sick at this , for all those who have had to cope with seeing loved ones die alone or struggled to get necessities . Shame on you , @USER , shame ! P . S . Nobody believes you had it , and if you did , you should have stayed at home longer . HTTPURL
@USER @USER @USER surely there is a safeguarding issue by @USER placing his child in a confined space for several hours with a person displaying signs of covid 19 . 1/2

Seeing more and more people recently saying they have family / friends who have died from underlying health conditions . They had coronavirus , but it was n't the cause of death , yet death certificates are stating the cause of death was just that :face_with_monocle: :thinking_face:
@USER Whatever way they spin it it 's totally unacceptable , as a family we believed if we contracted Coronavirus we should not leave home , the guidance was clear HTTPURL
@USER @USER Most without masks nor gloves ( in my experience ) . What we do n't know is how many have caught #Covid19 . Some will have died , of course , and some will have stayed home to protect themselves and / or their family members .
So this vaccine had side effects including muscle aches , fever and fatigue , which lasted up to 28 days . Might as well just get the virus instead of the vaccine . HTTPURL
STAY HOME FOR 14 DAYS IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF CORONAVIRUS * ( * unless you would prefer to travel somewhere that a family member will bring hot meals to your door )
@USER There 's an element of not be as ill as you say you are in this - no way driving 200 + miles with Covid 19 a good idea #ToryLies
Is it safe to drive 270 miles with your child in the car whilst suffering from Covid - 19 symptoms ? Surely any responsible parent would say no ? HTTPURL
“ entirely right ” . Well that totally changes all of our views on the rules . This is so dangerous . Second wave pretty much guaranteed now . HTTPURL
It 's of course exactly because Covid - 19 makes people so ill that the government brought in regulations to stop its spread . HTTPURL
This sets an extremely worrying and dangerous precedent . I 'm genuine shocked ( I know by now I really should n't be ) that the government are rallying around him on this issue . HTTPURL
I thought something like this was meant to happen if you were suspected of travelling with coronavirus ? #dominiccummimgs #DailyBriefing HTTPURL
Both my son and daughter had #COVID19 symptoms and very ill , but I did n't go and help with my 2 yr old granddaughter because we were in lockdown . #Cummings
Just asking . If 80 percent of us develop a mild illness when contracting Covid 19 and if my partner has contracted that illness but is well enough to travel 250 miles , and if I have n't yet developed any symptoms and am quite capable of driving 250 miles , should I
@USER Yeah , but did you have a 3yr old child & were you & your partner sick with potentially life-threatening Coronavirus & a chance 2 become so ill as to be unfit to care 4 your child unless you enlisted help of a family member ...
@USER I 'm shielding my elderly folks . My dads brother lives one street away and we have n't seen him for 10 weeks . Your Government clearly thinks the British public are idiots . All of you should resign #ResignBoris #COVID19 #GTTO #CumminsGate
@USER What I want to know is why when I had COVID 19 symptoms I had to stay on my house until symptoms had passed 4 weeks ! And my family including toddler had to isolate in my home for 14 days not be dropped off with family ?
By driving in that state 200 miles to his elderly parents ' home , placing them at risk , too ? You advised anyone who had the virus not to go out for ANY reason , not even food or medicine . You 're the Health Minister : stop defending his reckless , selfish behaviour . He should go . HTTPURL
Hang on , what about if we are ill ? Is that a definate yes or no to visits . I 'm confused #dominiccummimgs :thinking_face: HTTPURL
It is a dangerous time when these people are in charge ... HTTPURL
@USER @USER Understand your reaction . But coronavirus is n't going away anytime soon . How we deal with it going forward is most important issue . Vulnerable people are always going to be vulnerable people even when lockdown is relaxed . We have to learn to live with it , within risks .
But this wo n't be headline news tonight ... seems to be something far more bothering ... right or wrong .. but the progress being made & what this means for our liberties going forward is far more news worthy ... HTTPURL
Things may be bad here in the UK ... but they could be SO much worse ! :confused_face: HTTPURL

@USER @USER Not many in the community have been tested yet . My daughter and husband have n't been anywhere near a hospital but were very sick with COVID 19 symptoms . They 've just done the Abbott antibody tests and are positive
This is all so utterly utterly disgraceful and shameless . I 've had residents I represent tell me they 're worried about never seeing their ( grand ) parents again . But , it 's another rule for the Tory elite ? HTTPURL
@USER Do you have children naomi ? I had coronavirus like symptoms in January . No chance if me and my wife were struck down with it at the same time could we have cared for our children with no family support . Do you suggest people let toddlers fend for themselves while thy fight Covid ?

@USER Did they test u for Covid 19 ?
Ow Matt just please say what you really think , you were doing so well until this ! If you have symptoms do not leave the house ! Rule 1 . So how can you say it was right ? HTTPURL

If immunity really does only last six months , then a vaccine against the coronavirus will be impossible . We 're going to have to learn to live with this thing . HTTPURL
@USER @USER @USER Travelling for specific reasons and observing the 2m rule are only relevant considerations if you do n't already have the Coronavirus .
So the guidance said that you should stay at home if you have symptoms and so should everyone in your household ... but now it 's ok to send your kids to another home ( probably ) carrying the virus ? :face_with_steam_from_nose: HTTPURL

Quite a significant warning . Prior to today , government had hinted at potentially harsher measures if instructions are n't followed . This warning is more detailed and would greatly increase the sense of nationwide cabin fever . #marr #covid19 #lockdown HTTPURL

@USER I 've been in ICU on a number of occasions and they 're very scary places in calmer times but I was able to have visitors , it will be super scary on your own . The nurses were stretched before #coronavirus so imagine it now . Just #StayAtHome for yours and the #NHSworkers sake

How could countries be flattening the curves when not everyone has been tested ? I had #COVID2019 but I was n't considered at risk so never had a formal test , meaning my case would n't be on any of these charts . Until there is mandatory mass testing , we will never know who has it HTTPURL

Something about covid 19 is very off .. 6 bus drivers have died , but they do n't touch people like that , yet not that many in the medical field have died who are around it everyday or even supermarket workers . I know people are dormant carriers but I just do n't really get it .
If anyone was in any doubt how serious this virus is ... should now be in no doubt . Fingers crossed for Boris , and all others suffering from #COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives

@USER A delivery from Italy was expected yesterday . The package has arrived in London , but they are sending it back to Italy due to Coronavirus . How 's that is possible ? Please , clarify if you are n't delivering packages anymore . Thanks
@USER Essentially everyone has a chance of dying in the next 12 months . That chance is higher if you 're old or have an underlying condition . If you get #coronavirus , that likelihood of dying is compressed into 2 weeks .

@USER Sadly , due to the slow start to implement the risk of #coronavirus , the USA will see the highest deaths across the world , given that 7,000 deaths already in Italy of 60 million people . I hope I am wrong , but for Trump to start saying , we want to get back to business in 14 days ?

Coronavirus : Risk in UK lockdown easing too soon , warn scientists HTTPURL
I wish we were told exactly how many passed away from Covid and how many from other causes ! We know every death is being certified as Covid regardless ! HTTPURL
Wow absolutely shocking . How much more scientific evidence does one need @USER the speed at which #COVID19 has risen is worrying and you are playing with lives . HTTPURL
Of course it is serious but need to look at profile of those dying . We should have protected care homes and vulnerable more and let others get on with supporting the economy . Blanket lockdown was wrong . But we did n't know that then . We do now so we should release quicker . HTTPURL
@USER having worked through most of this pandemic over the past few months it 's horrifying to see queues like this along our sea front ! Social distancing at its worse ! @USER this is why WSM has had a surge in #coronavirus HTTPURL

The same in Chester @USER . Very worrying :crying_face: :blue_heart: HTTPURL
As an A & E Nurse you have terrified me , I pray that you do n't cause a second wave of #COVID19 . I do n't want to spend , like I have done the last couple months , in full PPE every shift ! These views are extreme and hope those sensible enough realise this virus is deadly :disappointed_face: #HydePark HTTPURL

@USER @USER It was co-amoxiclav . It does n't matter though . Unless I had Covid - 19 test , I 'll not know if I had it , and , if so , whether it was then . The SOB was bad enough for me to go into patient access online to see the type of puffer spray I had been prescribed previously .

There are so many things we do not know about Covid - 19 and the increasing reports of Covid linked Kawasaki disease in children ( however small the number may currently be ) needs proper research before we make ' grand ' statements about the safety of children HTTPURL

People who think Coronavirus is nothing more than a flu should watch Sky News this morning showing inside one hospital in Italy ! It is heart breaking ! !
I 'm seeing tweets about a 20 % cap on the number of children who should be in school next week – is this actual guidance ? Help appreciated . #coronavirus #SchoolsClosure #edutwitter
Testing should include all the teaching staff working in schools across England as they & their families are not in a position to apply the ‘ social distancing ' guidance . HTTPURL
- As far as i 'm concerned , if its not safe for me to leave the house , then its not safe for my children to return to school either ! Boris Johnson can kiss my arse ! :OK_hand: nobody 's using my children as their experiment guinea pigs :sparkling_heart: @USER HTTPURL
How long I have to wait for a test ? Nearly 2 months ago on my daily travel to work on public transport & surrounded by coughing ppl , I got infected by the Virus .

@USER @USER I like the idea but do wonder if placing a number of over 70s in one place e . g . @USER could be dangerous if there are #Coronavirus carriers within this group ?
Schools are closed they say ! ! ! NO THEY ARE NOT . The list of key workers is quite extensive and there will be a lot of children still at school , schools will still be very busy as per usual . @USER This is a very mixed message . HTTPURL
Have we got any test kits ? Is this why we are not being tested ? Is this the result of the way we are running the NHS ? HTTPURL
Very concerned about item on @USER about how @USER has without notice sacked staff and compunded this by also making them homeless . Outrageous and incomprehensible during unprecedented global #pandemic . How does this contribute to how we are tackling #coronavirus ?
A lot to follow here but it appears soon after two senators found out that the pandemic was going to hit the US economy they went public to reassure citizens that ‘ all will be well ' and in private sold millions of $ in stock saving them millions in losses . #Illegal #unethical HTTPURL
Serious question : Does Coronavirus kill anyone or does it weaken your system to the extent that something else does ?
The #coronavirus is affecting people of all ages who are also infecting the most vulnerable . Need to follow guidance on washing hands and keeping a distance . HTTPURL

The Chancellor 's statement today must include measures for people who have already lost their jobs as a result of COVID 19 . My wife is 30 weeks ' pregnant and was made redundant a week ago , before even the first measures to help businesses were announced . She earned more than me .

I fear hospital acquired clusters of #COVID19 are going to be a feature of this pandemic in the UK . Crowded hospitals , too little testing and a shortage of PPE are a dangerous combination . Running elective work in acute hospitals until mid April is madness
DRIVE THROUGH TESTING NOW . Our mortality rate is high because of the sheer volume of untested & undiagnosed people while so many are swanning about thinking they wo n't get it . And this is a sentence that I am tweeting nowadays it seems . HTTPURL

@USER Yup . But I did n't feel stellar yesterday and my wife has got snotty so think it 's just a cold . Not sure if I 'm on 7d isolation or 14 now ... very confusing . Clearer cut if fever and cough but I would n't wish Coronavirus on anybody .
Surely this just means the vulnerable people from small communities where they 're safest , will now decide to travel to busier areas to a big pharmacy where they will have a far greater chance of exposure to #covid19 #coronavirus Is there anything that can be done to balance this ?
