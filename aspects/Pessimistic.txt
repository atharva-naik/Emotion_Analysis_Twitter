@USER @USER COVID - 19 will only last 3-6 months and you may suffer badly for 2 weeks . You also know IT WILL IMPROVE . Unfortunately , watching West Ham causes a lifetime of suffering :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

When the current period in politics is reflected upon by future generations , one thing is clear : no historian will say the actions of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings saved tens of thousands of lives during the COVID 19 pandemic .
@USER @USER 179 service men looks like a drop in the ocean now does n't it , compared to covid - 19 numbers . Something which would have been much lower had Johnson acted sooner . Still no track and trace either , the most effective way to deal with the pandemic
Hmmm did n't exactly turn out that way . As I 've tweeted before #Science beats #Politics everyday of the week ! US Deaths near 1 0 0 0 0 0 ! ! ! HTTPURL HTTPURL

Given the evidence around us now with the lack of social distancing and the Government 's future plans , I expect a #Covid19 spike in the UK around June 15-29 with the ‘ R ' figure well over 1 ...
So far 2020 has been the most testing , miserable & boring year ever :confused_face: #storms #floods #coronavirus #COVID19 #lockdownuk

U . K 's huge fundings for vaccine and trials for promising drugs may be be wasted , at the end there may be no outcome . What 's point in these efforts , after 40000 deaths ? Not a single report is ready yet from any trial on therapeutic drugs in the U . K . but look at other countries . HTTPURL

@USER Hi Victoria , I have an idea for the govennment . With all of the 100s of 1000s of people losing their jobs during the covid 19 why not get over 60s to start drawing their OAP by giving up their full time job , to the young . Better than young with mortgages on dole .

Recent figures suggest 1 in 10 of our workforce look set to be unemployed as a result of the coronavirus crisis . For peoples ' future prospects , incomes and their health , the Government must do all it can to protect incomes and support people back into work when Britain recovers

2020 has been an absolute plunder job . Storms every weekend , raining every day and now coronavirus about to put the final nail in the coffin
Better to prepare for the worst than to pretend it wo n't happen ! The UK 's Covid - 19 stricken economy is facing a Brexit cliff 's edge . The UK 's high level of debt & declining credit rating means we can not borrow our way back from disaster if we go over the cliff . HTTPURL
@USER If this is the new slogan , then everyone will just come out and in 2 weeks time , new cases will rise , people losing their lives will rise and we will have to go back into lockdown again . It is a mess . HTTPURL
Another example of how dismal our logistics are . The background fabric of the country is threadbare and when push comes to a shove , does n't work . The truth of the matter is we are not as good as we thought we were . Roll on Brexit when the sh * t will really hit the fan . HTTPURL
This summer was shaping up to be the busiest for the travel industry in decades . Now , hotels could shutter forever and airlines close , as the industry faces £ 970bn of losses . For many travellers hoping to get their money back , it could be a long slog . HTTPURL

3 Brighton players have #COVID19 yet the league will still find a way to finish the season . Is it worth it ?
@USER Do the people of the devolved nations want Covid - 19 death rates equivalent to USA . To put current deaths into perspective , if all CORVID - 19 related deaths are counted in April , it amounts to at least 40,000 in UK . Thats , about 10 % of all UK WW2 deaths . In ONE MONTH .

31,578 people have sadly died of covid - 19 ... but in a ' great depression ' over 20 + million will be unemployed , over 3 + million will die of hunger / poverty , The people who want lockdown to carry on on on on will bankcrupt the country & see more die of hunger / poverty , than of covid - 19

As usual BBC peeps stop short of meaningful comment . Would n't be such a catastrophic downturn if we stayed in th EU . HTTPURL
@USER @USER @USER Just like Covid - 19 the lock downs are just as ineffective as the climate solutions of wind and solar while they are just as damaging to our economy . Net zero and lockdowns have been and will be an ecconomic disaster .
And this ladies and gents is why the pubs will not open for some considerable time ! The world is laughing at us . HTTPURL

Will there be a second wave of coronavirus ? HTTPURL
People seem to think that as long as there 's capacity at hospitals , they wo n't die . Just because you 're at hospital , does n't meant they can save you . Just ask the 26,345 people who have died of Covid - 19 in UK hospitals .

To the people who thought we should have went into lockdown sooner this is why we went in when we did . Lockdown has led to social fatigue and social unrest . If we went into it earlier the social fatigue would have hit when we reached the peak . HTTPURL

There are few certainties in life . But a coronavirus spike in 2 weeks because of people doing the actual conga down the street is probably one of them .

@USER Not good at all . Effectively the threat of the Coronavirus is killing people just by being in existence ie not actually contracting it
Does n't look like the model is working @USER the COVID - 19 deaths seem to be dropping one day and increasing the next , a 4week full lockdown is needed to sort this mess out ! no one should be aloud into the UK or leave it
Unless a peak becomes plateau & a plateau becomes a dip , lock down must continue Otherwise a second surge will be a massive clinical disaster & economy 's free fall @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL

The experience of other countries is that approx 50 % of Covid 19 deaths are in Care Homes . This means we only need to double Hospital deaths to get near the real awful truth . If Hospital deaths reach 20,000 we will be faced with 35-40 Thousand dead . HTTPURL
Oh it 's dangerous still on Covid 19 - realism setting in that it 's not solved - and oh we 're similar on deaths to rest of Europe apart from Germany . @USER briefing sounds like justifying the mess and deaths many of which they ought to and could have avoided .
@USER We 'll all pay for it over the coming years . If the Coronavirus does n't kill us the austerity measures and tax hikes after all this will

It is not about austerity but about not knowing how to spend our money . We just waste money hence we are in this situation . Even now money is being thrown but competent people know where the problem is , how to plan , implement and monitor . We find innovative ways to waste ! ! HTTPURL
It 's thought that if we add up all the deaths from hospitals and society we become the second highest after USA . Having other countries showing cases ahead of us to learn from , I have to agree this is a terrible result #SaveLives #COVID19
@USER @USER @USER @USER I suspect Europe , not the #EU , will be forced into a UBI situation quite soon , but paying for it will be the issue , bricks and mortar retailers are not going to come out of covid 19 well , oil has fallen , resulting in less tax revenue for government spending , what to tax instead ?

@USER now then , that is how you handle a global pandemic . Uk is 11 times bigger so , 20000 cases and 260 deaths if we 'd followed NZ . Incompetent buffoonery has cost us 50000 lives and £ billions , are a big well done ! Fin :middle_finger: :medium_light_skin_tone: :folded_hands: :light_skin_tone: HTTPURL

@USER This is not even true , once the pandemic has passed , we will see average deaths dip due to the shortage of pensioners thanks to covid - 19 & the tories
@USER @USER @USER @USER the " comeback " is merely back to a few months ago when people were unable to work , therefore spend . It 's short term due to your failure to even attempt to deal with #COVID19 . Rep stares stayed open & all but @USER re-opened too soon . HTTPURL

@USER The other point is that the window to act decisively was scarily narrow . covid 19 was only a thing in late January and by mid march it was already too late . My concern here is that any pandemic planning should have considered a coronavirus originating in the Far East ( eg SARS )
Unfortunately this damning article is all too believable ! Our response would have been best in class if we had n't wasted five years on austerity and brexit . Thousands of lives could have been saved if we had acted more firmly in February and March . Read and weep ! HTTPURL

With the return to work and increased use of public transport , an increase in #Covid19 infections seems almost inevitable . Sincerely hope we wo n't see any ' knee jerk ' reintroduction of full lock down , - ' distanced ' exercising in open air never was a problem , and never will be .
This is going to be an interesting experiment . I give England TWO WEEKS before covid 19 has dramatically escalated to a level that requires a tightening of lockdown . However in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland , we will be watching and learning

#coronavirus is becoming the new #Brexit for splitting the nation ? Seems to be equal measures of ‘ exaggerated , over reaction , too much economic damage versus the risk ' and ‘ the biggest catastrophe of our time , poorly managed , our lives are changed forever , we 're bankrupt .

How do you keep children 2 metres apart ? It 's a myth that children do n't get #COVID19 . If you open schools , more people will die . This govt is playing roulette with people 's lives . 30k ppl dead is ridiculous and it 's because of this Govt 's incompetence . They have to be removed .
If we do n't watch it , the UK could see 50k - plus dead due to #COVID19 and the appalling policies of this dreadful Tory Government . And that 's unforgivable to me .

@USER Covid 19 is a notifiable illness . Rather than people dying of it & it not being noted its just as likely that people will die of other causes but be listed as a C19 caused death . It 's like having cancer but dying of heart failure . Was the cancer a contributing factor ?

@USER That 's one farm . Just one in the whole UK . There were over a million unemployed people in the UK before COVID - 19 hit , there is no shortage of labour for agricultural work . Farms need to be actively recruiting UK workers and not exploiting cheap overseas labour .
We will be social distancing for the next year or so unless by miracle a vaccine appears sooner . Therefore would it not make sense to throw millions at top drawer PPE for every UK citizen so the Country can have some kind of normality in the meantime ? #COVID19

Amazing how Covid - 19 has exposed the flaws in UK society : the impoverishment of the NHS ; the reality of our need for immigrants ; the tyranny of the motor vehicle ; and the triumph of local over chain shops . We need to act on these if we want to move forward .
He never explains what he means by " stronger than ever before . " 27,500 people wo n't emerge at all , having been killed by the coronavirus and there will be millions unemployed amid the biggest economic depression in 100 years . How will this make us stronger ? HTTPURL

I do n't get why were having to do this anymore . Can someone take me back to basics ? :person_shrugging: :medium_light_skin_tone: ‍ :male_sign: Data shows it mainly ( sadly ) affects elderly & those with specific pre-existing conditions . Why 're we not having those people continue to distance while rest of us go back to normal ? #covid19
@USER The things is you can be prepared for Covid 19 or a similar virus . Being better prepared for an influenza outbreak would have put us in a much better position . Many Asians countries are prepared for such an outbreak which is why they have faired so much better that the west .
Let 's not compete flu with the coronavirus . Globally flu kills 300-500 k . Our complacency on communicable diseases as a whole costs lives . PS get your flu ( and pneumococcal ) vaccine this year . HTTPURL
Life will never be the same for us ever again . We 've seen seeing something here you 'd never have believed #COVID19

Brexit is looming fast and with many firms distracted whilst focussing on their response to Covid - 19 it would be easy to lose sight of the work required to ensure EU domiciled risks can continue to be serviced . Kenneth Underhill looks at the issues . HTTPURL
@USER @USER Understood , but there is a food chain out there that is being exposed to COVID 19 unnecessarily . I expect the odds against the virus jumping to another species are enormous , but I would n't bet the whole world on them being zero . Just pay for an adequate treatment plant ! !
