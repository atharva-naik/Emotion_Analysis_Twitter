About bl * * dy time ! When I had symptoms back in March this was one of the most distinct and even now , 2 months on , I can't smell anything.Glad to hear this has been added to the list . BBC News - #Coronavirus symptoms : UK adds loss of smell and taste to list HTTPURL
Does this seem a little .. late ? In March there were swathes of people ( including me ) who 'd lost their sense of taste and smell and were told to stick to the advice which was only to isolate if they had a persistent cough and / or temperature . HTTPURL
Government are way to late issuing this symptom as we 've known about it for a while . I lost mine on day two ( March 25th ) and still not back yet . HTTPURL

Thinking a lot about TB services today and hearing concerns that due to COVID 19 , TB programs are going to be hit the hardest with GeneXpert machines for example being diverted for #COVID19 diagnosis . In this time joint COVID / TB outreach can be done and machines shld be increased .
When we get through the coronavirus crisis , we can not return to business as usual . For too long , social care has been neglected . Our care workers left underpaid and undervalued :backhand_index_pointing_down: :light_skin_tone: HTTPURL

@USER @USER @USER My uncle 74yrs old died in a care home after the home took the advice of the Gov and closed to visitors for 6weeks prior to him getting Coronavirus , any of the carers could have brought it in ( not tested ) 1 elderly resident sent back from the hospital untested into the home ?
@USER @USER @USER Life is full of risks and needs to get back to normal . In the last 6 weeks without any lockdown more under 30 ' s would have died in road accidents than have died from coronavirus .
@USER Gutted that we wo n't be travelling next week #StayHome #COVID19
@USER @USER @USER The week later 4 of the residents fell ill and after just one week of been ill my uncle died . Death certificate - Died of Coronavirus . So how can a care home or the nurses within the NHS take the blame if they have no chance of testing , surely you can't think it 's their faults

About bl * * dy time ! When I had symptoms back in March this was one of the most distinct and even now , 2 months on , I can't smell anything.Glad to hear this has been added to the list . BBC News - #Coronavirus symptoms : UK adds loss of smell and taste to list HTTPURL
Does this seem a little .. late ? In March there were swathes of people ( including me ) who 'd lost their sense of taste and smell and were told to stick to the advice which was only to isolate if they had a persistent cough and / or temperature . HTTPURL
Government are way to late issuing this symptom as we 've known about it for a while . I lost mine on day two ( March 25th ) and still not back yet . HTTPURL
Thinks back to some of my questionable taste in women :thinking_face: :thinking_face: HTTPURL
This is what my housemate had , unfortunately he did n't tell me until 4 days late but I stayed in for 10 . Luckily that was all he had and is fine now , as am I . HTTPURL
It 's #MHAW every week in my life but this year , seeing the seismic impact of #COVID19 on society , more than ever we need to be approaching MH cross-departmentally . Years of underfunding and backward-thinking got us here , only preventative strategy and investment can get us out .
Better late than never - I suppose - but how many people did people like myself infect when this was ignored / dismissed as a symptom . HTTPURL
@USER #goingbacktowork the streets are as deserted as last week . #ghosttown no traffic no one exiting #oxfordcircus #TFL and busses appear empty . 18th May 2020 . 10.30 am . #COVID19 @USER @USER @USER HTTPURL
So at week 9 ... I finally broke down and cried :loudly_crying_face: I think it 's my tipping point #InThisTogether #COVID19
The government follows the science , but this particular bit of science was obviously placed in a very complicated maze in March and they got lost on the way . #COVID19 HTTPURL
9 weeks gone and I still have n't got them back :nauseated_face: HTTPURL
Few weeks too late adding this to the list . Could n't taste or smell anything for abou 10 days a couple of months ago . 100 % had it then ! ! HTTPURL
@USER @USER My mental health is no better , in fact took a nose dive this weekend , really am struggling to keep it together . Yes I put happy smiley things on SM but inside is a different story altogether . Covid - 19 is n't helping matters being on my own almost 24/7 . The mind plays dirty tricks .
Why do u put your parent in nursing home Why do u make them suffer they your mother and your father they do not deserver this it the children 's job to look after them . HTTPURL

@USER Sincere condolences . I am sorry for your loss . x HTTPURL
Hundreds of thousands of school-leavers and graduates will find their futures postponed this year . Many will end up taking lower-paid work and thereby put themselves at a career disadvantage . Brexit also prevents them from seeking work in Europe . HTTPURL
Lost my sense of smell 8 weeks ago ( still not fully returned ) . I was denied a test and told to continue as normal . At this point there was significant media coverage about this as a symptom . Why has it taken so long for the guidance to change ? #COVID19 HTTPURL
I think it 's when we try and do ‘ normal ' things again , like taking a train , that the world will actually feel at its most abnormal . Being at home shields us from feelings weirdness as well as #COVID19 . Be ready to experience a range of emotions . Emptiness and distancing is sad . HTTPURL

Mine returned about a week ago & it 's the only symptom I 've had . I phoned 111 at the time for their advice & was told not to worry . My partner is on the vulnerable list but has n't shown any symptoms herself , so is it actually that contagious or not ? HTTPURL

@USER @USER He and Graham Gooch signed my Gunn & Moore ' no middle ' Junior at Hove sometime in the 80s . I remember little about the game . But I do remember being there with my family and spending the whole day together . There 's a Covid - 19 lesson in that somewhere for parents like me ...
I 'm not a fan of watching football on TV . I grew up in the 80s when live football on TV and I 've always preferred to watch my football from the stands . The idea of having to watch my team on TV with no fans in the ground is a depressing thought . But needs must . I hate #COVID19
Was going to post something poignant about our country & covid 19 . But I 'm just lost for words , the loss of life & the inability of scientific experts / government to do something to improve things is beyond comprehension - why do we always get so much wrong ?

Just heard on the news that an old couple both died of coronavirus in the same hospital , same room , 12hrs apart and oh my god , my heart :loudly_crying_face: :broken_heart:
So here 's a Covid 19 question . If I smoked during this respiratory debilitating disease ( that in itself is enough to want to give up surely ) and I drop the butt when I finish , if I 'm carrying the disease , how long will the germs live on the butt now floating round the streets ?
