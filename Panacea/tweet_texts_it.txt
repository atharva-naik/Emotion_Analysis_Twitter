@VarangianEngli @EricTopol @NatureMedicine @FLAHAULT @enenbee @hholdenthorp @RobertoBurioni @ProfCerbai All patients suffering from #COVID19 eventually developed antibodies, and this is good. Nevertheless, timing, mode and levels varied significantly, suggesting that protection against reinfection is not guaranteed (neither vaccine effectiveness).
Still, it's something.
During the first 3 weeks after symptom onset, there were increases in virus-specific IgG and IgM antibody titers. IgM showed a slight decrease in the &gt;3-week group compared to the ≤3-week group . IgG and IgM titers in the severe group were higher than those in the non-severe one https://t.co/jb4YqSDkeC

@GovernorObaseki Mr. Governor, too much emphasis and concentration on covid19 and statistical analysis without its aftermath.  What happens after the end of this pandemic?  The world is gearing up for economic rejuvenation but Africans are still on lockdown gimmicks.  Start to plan now or never.
@GovernorObaseki I support Obaseki to continue to govern Edo State bcos he is pragmatic and has modern governing skills but too much time is being wasted on Covid19 rhetorics and lockdown without its economic effects.  Let's look up to what will create economic surplus and wealth hereafter.

So your Senator decided to make a press release, showing off his throw pillows and claiming he did his "research" on 5G and #Covid_19, Well, he obviously doesn't know the meaning of research, so that was No 1 crap.

@tdwilliamsrome I’ve been wondering about this. Why some countries record deaths with Coronavirus as deaths *from* Coronavirus and others do not. I can understand why some would not, to make the numbers look lower and better. But what’s the advantage to having higher numbers?

How will COVID-19 reshape museums? How will fundraising change? The role of foresight is necessary to expand our vision, imagine possibilities, widen the pool of choices, envision a preferred future and identify what we can do. Elizabeth Merrit at #AAMvirtual #AAMSMJ
According to the economic model of re(growth): yes, museums will be different after Covid-19 in terms of architecture, offered tools and working staff. But they will have to be very profitable nonprofits. #AAMvirtual #AAMSMJ
Here’s some more good news out of #Italy:  Italy is in the double digits for its death toll for the first time since March 9th. On March 9th it was 97 people. Today is 99. #coronavirus

@soychicka This happened due to @POTUS  and his entire administration’s sense of American exceptionalism and denial. They thought in their sick twisted brains that somehow #COVID19 could never take hold on American soil. THE DEATHS OF SO MANY WILL BE THEIR LEGACY.

@realDonaldTrump Luckily, on the other side, USA has the “best predictor” on Earth....
95.000 victims you predicted (13 days ago...).
But, due to your previous “bad experiences” as predictor you added “or more” (!).
Now we’re there. Genius.

@wolfblitzer Wolf, it’s time for a brand new prediction coming from the “Best Predictor” available 🥶

@OGdelRancho Because she believes in the virus, because she believes that HIV causes AIDS (my husband was supposedly HIV +for more than 25 yrs and I've studied it), bc she says that virus could be a bio weapon. In my opinion, there is no Covid-19 at all.
@TonyTow78233280 @ToilsomeOlive She believes that Covid-19 is real. That's enough for me, but she also believes that HIV causes AIDS. My late husband was HIV +and I know a lot about it. She's pro vax, despite knowing what's in vaccines. I'm sure there's more, but I stopped listening.

@SpaceDojo_ @bitcoin_collect @saifedean 1st part true: during the winter some Lombardy ICUs have been overcrowded (not the 1st time in the last decade, as you can see from archive news, but still serious &amp; dramatic). 2nd part false: hand-surgery rooms have *not* been turned into covid19 ICUs.

@dottcorbelli @gavinjones10 @lorepregliasco The point is that we now have 65,000 active COVID-19 cases in Italy. Out of this "population" of 65,000, 100–200 die every day. It's a daily mortality rate of 1/325–650, while the overall daily mortality rate in Italy is normally 1/35,000 people.
Do you understand the difference?
@dottcorbelli @gavinjones10 @lorepregliasco In other words, a person who tested positive is about 100 times more likely to die today than any average individual. Then we can conjecture that most of those 100–200 deaths aren't due to COVID-19 only if we rape statistics.

#Easter #covid19
Faith in the Age of #coronavirus. So today is Easter Sunday and we had our FIFTH service on Zoom. We had 63 connections. Considering that we are a church with 100 members and most of them are not technically "advanced" I got to say that we had a good turnout 1/5
@TBroekel @M_Pagano_Econ My opinion is that, given different starting distributions, the post-coronavirus will be more punitive for the struggling countries without correct measures with the result that the more skewed distr will become even more skewed on the left.

@AnnetteInBxl Here in Turin, I’ve noted that the fancy Italian ladies who go to the hairdresser every week have disappeared. I don’t know if it’s a direct consequence of the coronavirus or the impact of the lockdown or if it’s because they don’t look fancy anymore 😉
@J_Hayter1 @DavidHa80098920 @shambusters @adamboultonSKY @MattHancock @skynewsbreaking Two months ago everyone was saying “Italy has the second oldest population in the world, that’s why it has been badly hit by Coronavirus”. The Chief Scientist aimed to keep deaths under 20,000. The UK has the second highest death toll in the world but 21st biggest population

#COVID19 Update 🇮🇹

8014 recoveries reported today in Italy, but new cases &amp; deaths back up. https://t.co/wBRtaDsnZP
🇮🇹 For the first time Italy’s total number of recovered patients is greater than active #COVID19 cases!
@Ussignur_ @gavinjones10 @istsupsan @istat_it The official figure of COVID-19 deaths accounts for slightly more than a half of this surplus deaths. Can you imagine any other reason why so many more people died in March 2020 compared to March 2019 (and compared to any March in recent years)?

This coronavirus proves how poorly run the italian government is. What a sad place to live
@danielhowdon @IHME_UW I noticed the Italian data was well out claiming the ICU capacity required at peak would be over 7000 but it actually peaked at just over 4000 a week ago. I’m finding the Italian data much easier to navigate and fully collated than the UK’s (link attached)

Why doesn't anyone talk about the deaths in Belgium? 
And why does nobody use the data as a percentage of the population, for example the Italian regions?  You only see the absolute data but these have a different value when compared to the number of inhabitants. https://t.co/RhFshzsEhe

@BOGbadamosi The cure for COVID-19 could be available in Africa using different methods but taking it through scientific research for simple understanding will make them wait for scientists in other climes to break the record.  Africans are not supposed to die of coronavirus.

@ShehuSani As Dokpesi stated, if malaria in Africa means coronavirus in Europe and America, it was difficult to contain.  There is (was) no malaria in these countries and were taken unaware by the coronavirus. Those who have survived it here were treated by medicine for influenza(fever)

@ShehuSani In work places around Europe and elsewhere, workers are tested with temperature equipment before access is granted to work or enter Supermarkets.  Fever is a high symptom of COVID-19 that generates into other complications.

@piersmorgan Piers recommendation is that football matches be suspended due to lack of spectators and thereby abort the leagues half way. This is not well thought out.  Football Entertainments can heal the world faster and weaken coronavirus spread.

@upwizard @BorisJohnson You have your stats SO wrong. People calling 111 with mild symptoms are told to self isolate and are not tested. Asymptomatic people by definition have no idea they have #coronavirus... and aren’t tested. Not testing people doesn’t make them not infected! #wakeup

@MetalMickey745 @adamboultonSKY @MattHancock @skynewsbreaking Sorry but you’re very mistaken. I read the Italian stats. The Protezione Civile has been recording all Covid-19 deaths since the start, in and out of hospitals. Like the UK the figures are an understatement by about 50% (same as UK) due to undiagnosed fatal cases

@MetalMickey745 @adamboultonSKY @MattHancock @skynewsbreaking Christ. I’m quoting the same source as Reuter’s, and translating it into English. ISTAT is the equivalent of ONS, and it’s showing that excess deaths are just under double official Covid-19 deaths. The same as UK’s official Covid vs ONS excess death toll https://t.co/Qn8zV2N6yw https://t.co/9PKMr4DiTq
@MetalMickey745 @adamboultonSKY @MattHancock @skynewsbreaking Claiming that Italy is under-reporting by showing its official Covid19 death toll is 54% of all excess deaths makes no sense because that’s exactly the same as the UK - the official Covid19 death toll is also about 54% of all excess deaths. Both figures are higher for UK

Italy’s new case rate each day was consistently under 2,000 and under 5% of tests coming back positive before lockdown was relaxed (to UK levels)

@MetalMickey745 @adamboultonSKY @MattHancock @skynewsbreaking Wrong. They record all Covid-19 deaths where they happen, in and outside of hospitals, their recording is as “sporadic” as the UK in that both are under-reporting particularly deaths in the community, to about the same extent, which I have demonstrated with statistics
