@WSJ The risk is minimized and acceptable if selecting genetically relative safe cohorts who previously easily survived covid-19 
plus administered anti-viral Gilead Remsdescivir in addition to experimental vaccination.Antibodies show up with effectiveness of vaccine.

@titobohrt @HayekAndKeynes It's indeed shown confusingly, but I think it compares risk of dying of Coronavirus if you catch it to general risk of dying in one year of life. Basically Coronavirus roughly doubles your risk of dying that year if you catch it, whatever age you are (exception the very young)
