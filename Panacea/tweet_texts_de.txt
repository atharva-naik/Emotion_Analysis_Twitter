About 115k people died because of Covid-19 in the USA, 408k World wide. Clearly even 0.something percent make a huge difference. Wear a mask, stay inside, or only move with a 6 feet clear radius around you. Don't try to pull numbers that folks can't put a face to, that's low. https://t.co/4lnZ5nPFcP

@Iyervval I must say I’m pleasantly surprised with the reports on how the govt is handling #coronavirus . Here it’s up to the commune to decide on a plan of action so it’s kind of everybody for themselves.
This nonsense upps my prediction to 30% of all us citizen may die to their ignorance towards a virus, that kills less than 1% of all infected globally. https://t.co/3OnbptrTgI

@Ventairlol @HatrixxLoL Those are different viruses, the coronaviruses are multiple different strains with the same basic structure. „SARS“ is also a coronavirus, and it’s far more deadly.

To be clear, deporting asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants is always a gross and inhumane violation of human rights. To use covid-19 as an excuse to make these acts more palatable is rotten to the core.

@mickp1978 This might well be the case. Undoubtedly, there’s been a noticeable surge in cyberattacks on the back of the #covid19 pandemic.

It's basically that show, Coronavirus and opossums. I don't even get actual news anymore.

As a government, you can't bullshit-talk yourself out of the #COVID19 #pandemic. You can't defeat it with symbolic actions, you can't weaken its impact with finger pointing and you can't just wait it out. It's the ultimate test of any government. A reality check.

@WSJ The risk is minimized and acceptable if selecting genetically relative safe cohorts who previously easily survived covid-19 
plus administered anti-viral Gilead Remsdescivir in addition to experimental vaccination.Antibodies show up with effectiveness of vaccine.
It must list during Covid-19 ...

The Lord is reaching out into the hearts of this generation using the Coronavirus to catch their attention to listen to the instructions of preparing the garment of #AppearingBeforeGod
It is not possible to ignore God.
.@BrunoRguezP: The #COVID19 attacks a world marked by economic and social inequality, where there are 820 million hungry people, 2 billion malnourished people and 3 billion who have no way to wash their hands. Its devastating effects fall on the most vulnerable.

#AppearingBeforeGod
Only Jesus can save the world.

Is the world aware that only  Jesus is the Saviour of the world.
This generation has been judged with the Coronavirus because of rebellion and yet no one seem to understand that only Jesus can save them.
@PaulSemenye1 The Lord is always willing to Cleanse our sins
It is very important for this generation to wake up and stop the rebellion
There is no way this generation can reject the grace of God and live in peace on this earth
The Coronavirus is the evidence that sin hurts

Deaths, deaths, deaths! If #COVIDー19 weren’t as lethal as it is, we would not have Covid-19 crises. The excess death rates and the damage caused to humans‘ health makes it imperative to do all it takes to keep infection rates low. This includes testing, testing, testing. https://t.co/LugCNSVkOT

There is cause for major alarm because of how Covid is spread. Other VIRUSES eg HIV  kill more annually but no one panics as now because Covid19 spread technique is super rapid.

@JoeySalads @JoshuaPotash This is so wrong in so many ways. Even children die of covid19. Here in Europe we had quite a few dead children because of #Corvid19. The youngest so far was 7 or 8 years old. Please educate yourself and until then keep your gob shut.

@titobohrt @HayekAndKeynes It's indeed shown confusingly, but I think it compares risk of dying of Coronavirus if you catch it to general risk of dying in one year of life. Basically Coronavirus roughly doubles your risk of dying that year if you catch it, whatever age you are (exception the very young)

An insufficient air conditioning system which “recycled untreated air” was “just one factor” that contributed to the huge #COVID19 outbreak at the #Tönnies abattoir in #Germany.

That’s according to Prof Martin Exner, tasked with finding the cause. 

The view from #Güttersloh https://t.co/QnAPqzespc
Industry analysts say 30,000 pigs are slaughtered at the #Toennies factory in Germany per day. 

The company has a reported annual turnover of 7 billion euros and employs 7,000 workers.

But there are so  more areas- and the coronavirus crisis is revealing some of them.

For one, micro models used to argue policy need to be moving from wealth-based maximization- profit for firms, intertemporal income/consumption for agents- to risk-adjusted....
This isn‘t the end of the thread, I‘ll have more thoughts to spew as I go. I‘m still sort of organizing this- but I had that much done and thought it was worth putting it out there.

I‘m getting to how this relates to policy and situations we’re dealing with in coronavirus.
